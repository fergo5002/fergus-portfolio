/**
 * Mutation check for the contact form.
 *
 * Not part of the build and not run by `npm test`. Like `Dockerfile.parity`,
 * it exists to be run deliberately before shipping a change to this feature.
 *
 * **Why it is committed rather than thrown away.** The claim "the tests would
 * catch that" is worth exactly nothing unless somebody has tried. This repo has
 * already shipped a guard whose test was the implementation restated and could
 * therefore never fail, and `docs/PROGRESS.md` used to assert a mutation count
 * that nothing in the repo could reproduce. This file is that assertion turned
 * into something anyone can re-run:
 *
 *     node scripts/mutation-check.mjs
 *
 * Each entry breaks one guard on purpose, runs the suite, and restores the file.
 * A guard that survives its own mutation is decoration, and the run says so.
 *
 * Two rules learnt the hard way, both encoded below:
 *  - **Anchors are regexes tolerant of CRLF.** `app/globals.css` uses CRLF, and
 *    an anchor written with a bare "\n" silently matched nothing.
 *  - **A missing anchor is a failure, never a skip.** A SKIP line in a column of
 *    REDs reads as a pass at a glance, which is how the first version of this
 *    hid a mutation that was never actually applied.
 *
 * Restoration writes the original text back rather than running `git checkout`,
 * so an unrelated uncommitted change in the same file cannot be destroyed by a
 * mutation run.
